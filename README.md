# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

In this project I built a functional website that allows users to chose whether or not they would like to receive a mantra or an affirmation. Users could then create and delete mantras at their leisure. This application is to be used as a resource for randomized mantras or affirmations that allows them to pick which one best represents their need at the time of use as well as customize it to their needs.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

1. clone from https://github.com/LISims88/self-care-center
2. cd  into desired directory 
3. Type : git clone git@github.com:LISims88/self-care-center.git
4. Cd into the project folder
5. Open the project in your code editor of choice 
                Or 
6. type in terminal open index.html


### Preview of App:

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

This project roughly to took 15-20 hours to complete. It was due February 18, 2024, and I at the time of completion was a first 6 week quarter, in their third week of eduation.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

This project was a part of the Turing School of Software and Design's curriculum to reinforce the learning of students in semantic HTML and CSS comp building as well as strengthen our own style and understanding of coding.  



### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

The largest win and challenge I faced while creating this project was fixing a problem that I originally didn't expect with the build out. While it is so easy to remember the use of .pop and .push, there are times when we have to be creative in the way things are done, buy using .unshift to get the desire results for a user problem that may never arise, but to anticipate the problem and solve it before it happens was the biggest win in my opinion.
